abstract = "It is frequently necessary to manipulate large sparse matrices by means of a computer. In such cases a lot of CPU time and memory space can be saved if only the non-zero elements are stored. This paper surveys seven different “compact” representations of sparse matrices. The selected implementations will be compared with regard to the running time and the storage requirement."
